# Fixing Image Issues on GitHub Using Visual Studio Code

This guide provides a step-by-step process to fix image issues in GitHub repositories using Visual Studio Code. This method is particularly useful for ensuring image links remain consistent and functional.

## Steps to Fix Image Issues

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository:**
   - Fork the desired GitHub repository.
   - Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop.
   - Select 'Show in Explorer' to view files.

2. **Open the Repository in Visual Studio Code:**
   - Right-click on the repository folder.
   - Select 'Open with Code' to open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

3. **Viewing and Editing the README File:**
   - In Visual Studio Code, click on the README file.
   - Use the 'Preview' button in the upper right corner to view the README content.

4. **Create an Images Folder:**
   - Inside the project, add a new folder and name it 'images'.

5. **Moving Images to the Images Folder:**
   - Drag and drop the project's images into the 'images' folder.

6. **Fixing Image Links in README:**
   - Delete the broken image link in the README.
   - Drag the image from the 'images' folder and drop it into the README file in Visual Studio Code.
   - Visual Studio Code will automatically create a relative link.

7. **Handling External Images:**
   - For images not already in the project, take a screenshot or obtain the image file.
   - Save these images in the 'screenshots' folder or a similar location.
   - Rename the images for consistency and easy identification.

8. **Adding External Images to the Project:**
   - Drag and drop these external images into the 'images' folder in Visual Studio Code.

9. **Updating Image Links in README:**
   - Replace the old image links with the new ones from the 'images' folder.
   - Ensure each image is properly linked and displayed in the README preview.

10. **Committing and Pushing Changes:**
   - After updating the README and image links, commit the changes.
   - Push the changes to the GitHub repository.

11. **Verifying Changes on GitHub:**
   - Go to the GitHub repository page.
   - Refresh to see the new 'images' folder and updated README.
   - Verify that all images are correctly displayed and linked.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can ensure that all images in your GitHub repository are properly displayed and managed. This method is particularly useful for maintaining consistency and avoiding broken image links.
